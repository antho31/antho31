## 🎧 Passion Projects

Between 2018 and 2021, I was the creator and host of the podcast [Des Ondes Vocast](https://www.vocast.fr), a show dedicated to the medium's history and innovation in the radio industry. I used it as a sandbox for experimentation, particularly:
- I conducted [a study to demonstrate the ease with which podcast download figures can be manipulated](https://anthony-gourraud.medium.com/a-new-model-to-detect-the-thousands-of-fake-but-iab-certified-podcast-downloads-i-got-20cee2e2eb39) and subsequently [open-sourced the code](https://github.com/Vocast-fr/podcheater).
- I created a system that continuously recorded over 300 radio stations 24/7, storing [hourly recordings for up to 6 months](https://piges.vocast.fr). This led to the creation of [Vocazap](https://github.com/Vocast-fr/Vocazap), a platform offering random zapping by extracting snippets from random records.


## 📚 Continuous Learning

In the ever-evolving tech landscape, I believe in staying a student. From blockchain nuances to media trends, I'm always looking for the next big thing.
